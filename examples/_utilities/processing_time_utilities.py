class TimeCounter(object):
    """
    This class is used to measure the elapsed time of computing trace only for
    the exact (non-interpolation) method.

    In the interpolation methods using :mod:`Trace.InterpolateTraceOfInverse`,
    the trace at interpolant points are *pre-computed*, so we can easily find
    how much time did it take to compute trace in the pre-computation stage.

    However, in the direct method of minimizing GCV, we can only measure the
    total time of minimization process. To measure only the elapsed time of
    computing trace (which is a part of computing GCV) we pass an object of
    this class to accumulatively measure the elapsed time of a portion related
    to computing trace.

        >>>     TimeCounter, process_time, \

        >>> # Declare time counter object
        >>> time_counter = TimeCounter()

        >>> # Define a function
        >>> def function(time_counter):
        ...
        ...     # Count time with time object
        ...     time1 = process_time()
        ...     ...
        ...     time2 = process_time()
        ...
        ...     # Store the time in time_counter object
        ...     time_counter.add(time2 - time1)

    To measure the CPU time of all processors we use time.process_time() which

    After all failed trials, the only solution that measures time (for only
    scipy.optimize.differential_evolution) is to restrict the whole python
    script to use a single code. This function does that.

    Note, other scipy.optimize methods (like shgo) do not have this issue. That
    means, you can still run the code in parallel and the time.process_time()
    measures the CPU time of all cores properly.
