/// \class    Timer
///
/// \brief    Records elasped wall time between two events.
///
/// \details  The measured time is the *wall* time, not the *process time* of
///           the CPU.
///
///           **Example:**
///
///               Timer timer;
///               timer.start();
///
///               // Some CPU threads here.
///               // ...
///
///               // Note, this Time measures wall time, so the sleep() time
///               // counts toward the measured time.
///               sleep(1);
///
///               timer.stop();
///               double elapsed_time = timer.elapsed();
///
/// \note     The start and stop time variables *inside* this class must be
///           declared as \c double, and not \c float to have enough precision
///           for the subtraction of stop minus start time. However, the
///           elapsed time *outside* of this class can be declared as \c float.
