    Generates a sparse correlation matrix.

    In this function, we pre-allocated array of sparse matrix with presumed nnz
    equal to ``max_nnz``. If the number of required nnz is more than that, this
    function should be stopped and a newer array with larger memory should be
    pre-allocated. To stop openmp loop, we cannot use ``break``. Instead we use
    the ``success`` variable. A zero success variable signals other threads to
    perform idle loops till end. This way, the openmp is terminated gracefully.

          the matrix size.
        * :math:`d` is the dimension of space.
        * :math:`\\mathrm{Vol}_{d}(r/l)` is the volume of d-ball of radius
          :math:`r/l`.
        * :math:`l = 1/(\\sqrt[d]{n} - 1)` is the grid size along each axis,
          assuming the points are places on an equi-distanced structured grid.
        * :math:`k` is the Matern correlation function.

        * :math:`\\rho` is the sparse matrix density (input to this function).
        * :math:`\\tau` is the kernel threshold (output of this function).

    The adjacency :math:`a` is the number of points on an integer lattice
    and inside a d-ball. This quantity can be approximated by the volume of a
    d-ball, see for instance
    `Gauss circle problem<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gauss_circle_problem>`_
     in 2D.

    A non-zero kernel threshold is used to sparsify a matrix by tapering its
    correlation function. However, if the kernel threshold is too large, some
    elements of the correlation matrix will not be correlated to any other
    neighbor point. This leads to a correlation matrix with some rows that have
    only one non-zero element equal to one on the diagonal and zero elsewhere.
    Essentially, if all points loose their correlation to a neighbor, the
    matrix becomes identity.

    This function checks if a set of parameters to form a sparse matrix could
    lead to this issue. The correlation matrix in this module is formed by the
    mutual correlation between spatial set of points in the unit hypercube. We
    assume each point is surrounded by a sphere of the radius of the kernel
    threshold. If this radius is large enough, then the sphere of all points
    intersect. If the criteria is not met, this function raises ``ValueError``.
